                    For my graduation internship, I worked at Sorama B.V., who specializes in audio visualization
                    hardware.
                    For their then newest product, the <a href="https://sorama.eu/products/sorama-cam-iv64">CAM
                        iV64</a>,
                    the wanted a
                    demo to let potential buyers get to know the product within VR. The demo had been worked on by prior
                    interns, but did not reach the point where it demonstrated the product’s capabilities well enough.

                <H2>The task</H2>
                My task was to make the demo as good as possible, adding the missing functionalities, improving the
                visuals
                and performance. As most of the people at Sorama had little-to-no experience with Unity, I had to ensure
                that the project was as easily expandable as possible and that the documentation was clear on how
                everything
                works and could be used.
                </p>
                <p>
                <H2>The works</H2>
                A basic summary:
                I had developed the missing functionalities:
                <ul>
                    <li> Sampling audio</li>
                    <li> Visual frequency graph </li>
                    <li> Selecting a frequency range</li>
                    <li> Visualizing audio through Blobs on the screen</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    As I started the internship with little-to-no knowledge regarding audio from a programming
                    perspective, I began with sampling the audio outside of Unity, this way I could figure out how to
                    sample audio and bring it to a visual without having to directly apply this to a Unity component.
                </p>
                <div class="centered">
                    <img src="portfolio/games/sorama/audiosampling.gif" style="height: 315px;">
                    <p style="margin-top: -3px;">External sampling program, using <a
                            href="https://scottplot.net/">ScottPlot</a></p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Once the functionality was there, I ported it over to Unity, using “baked” audio sample files to
                    handle
                    multiple audio files at once without a major hit to performance. I had tried several options to
                    render
                    the graph, but in the end used <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-LineRenderer.html">the
                        Linerenderer</a>
                    as it was the best from what I had tried and had available.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Selecting the frequency range was done using sliders, and made use of the <a
                        href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.span-1?view=net-5.0">Span struct</a>
                    to
                    get the content
                    from the array directly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The blobs were visualized through a heat map shader that got the screen points with their strengths
                    passed
                    through as an array of data.
                    As the screen only needed a framerate of 24fps to match it’s real world counterpart, the system
                    could
                    use
                    that lower framerate to send the data to the GPU without having to worry about it being noticeably
                    delayed, as the game would run at 90fps.
                </p>

                    At the end of the internship, I held a presentation at the company showing the result of my work.
                    The
                    employees were very happy with the results and found it incredible that everything performed
                    smoothly in
                    VR with.
